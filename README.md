# CSharp-DataStructures-Algorithms-Fundamentals

Developed a comprehensive repository of essential data structures and algorithms implemented in C#, with clean, well-documented code and clear organization. This project demonstrates proficiency in core programming concepts such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, recursion, sorting, and searching algorithms. Ideal for technical interviews and foundational understanding, it reflects a strong grasp of algorithmic thinking and software engineering principles using .NET technologies.
